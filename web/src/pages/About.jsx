            <p>
                MetaPetz is a mixed-reality pet experience built exclusively for
                Meta Quest. It lets you adopt, customise, and interact with a virtual
                companion that appears directly in your real-world space through
                passthrough and spatial interaction.

                MetaPetz is being developed as part of the&nbsp;

                </a>,
                showcasing how playful mixed-reality interactions can be built using Quest’s
                newest spatial features and development tools.

                Each pet is created through your own choices and customisation options,
                giving you control over its appearance, colour, and style. MetaPetz aims
                to make virtual pets feel tangible inside your environment using Quest’s
                depth, surface detection, and hand-tracking capabilities. For example, waving your hand in a circular motion gets your pet to sit. When fingers are curled toward your body repeatedly, then your pet comes to you.
            </p>

            <p>
                The experience focuses on simple interactions, environmental presence,
                and playful behaviour.

                MetaPetz is designed around one goal: providing a fun, immersive, and
                personalised companion inside mixed reality on Meta Quest.
